    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "An algorithm is a step by step procedure , which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages ie an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flowchart:\n",
    "A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm. A flowchart can be helpful for both writing programs and explaining the program to others. Programmers often use it as a program planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudo Code: \n",
    "Pseudo code is a term which is often used in programming and algorithm based fields. It is a methadology that allows thr programmer to replresent the implementation of an algorithm. Simply , we can say that it's the cooked up representation of an algorithm.\n",
    "Often at times , algorithms are represented with the help of pseudo code as they can be interpreted by programmers no matter what their programming background or knowledge is . Pseudo code , as the name suggests , is a false code or a representation of code which can be understood by even a layman with some school level programming knowledge.\n",

    "### Why Python is essential for Data Analytics / Science / Engineering?\n",
    "- It uses elegant syntax , hence the programming is easier to read\n",
    "- It is an easy to access language.\n",
    "- The large standard library and community support for mathematics and data science puposes.\n",
    "- Python's interactive mode makes it easy to evaluate codes.\n",
    "- Python is a powerful language that can be integrated into programs to provide a customizable interface.\n",
    "- It allows developers to run the code on Windows , MacOS , UNIX and Linux.\n",
    "- It is open sourse interpretted , high level language . Use , download and program addition of pythons are all free of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an IDE?\n",
    "An IDE , or integrated development environment , enables programmers to consolidate the diffrent aspects of writing a computer program.\n",
    "An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user Interface (GUI).\n",
    "IDE's increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code , building executables , and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook \n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple , streamlined , document , document-centric experience.\n",
    "It is an interative computational environment in which you can combine code execution , rich text , mathematics , plots and rich media."
